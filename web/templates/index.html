    <h3>Machine Learning predictions of Bond Dissociation Energies (BDEs)</h3>
    <p>This tool predicts BDEs for single, non-cyclic bonds in neutral organic molecules consisting of C, H, O, and N
        atoms.
        Mean absolute errors are typically less than 1 kcal/mol for most compounds. To use, enter a SMILES string above
        and press submit.</p>
